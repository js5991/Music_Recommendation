This is the main module for song recommendation. This module reads in featureSelectedData.csv, which is a
cleaned data with features selected. What this module do is to show the user 20 songs that are most popular,
so that user would at least know some of the songs. The user will respond to these songs with 0 as dislike and
1 as like. After that, our algorithm will recommend other songs to the users.
